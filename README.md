# Call Center Optimization Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on optimizing call center operations using data analysis and forecasting techniques. The main objectives are:

1. Develop a forecasting model to predict future call volumes for the next quarter.
2. Analyze data for patterns to inform better resource allocation.
3. Identify peak call times.
4. Understand the distribution of issue categories over time.

## Importance of Call Center Optimization

Optimizing call center operations is crucial for:
- Cost-effectiveness
- Customer satisfaction
- Business success
- Efficient resource utilization
- Enhanced service quality
- Informed decision-making
- Improved productivity
- Meeting regulatory requirements
- Staying competitive
- Adapting to evolving customer needs

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Utilized a Kaggle dataset of call center operations.
2. **Data Analysis**: Identified trends and seasonality over years, months, and weekdays.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Addressed unsuitable data types for model building.
4. **Forecasting Models**: Developed and compared two models:
   - SARIMAX
   - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Key Findings

### Weekly Trend
- Highest call volume on Mondays
- Sharp decline on Tuesdays
- Steady numbers from Wednesday to Friday
- Lowest call volume on Saturdays
- Slight increase on Sundays

### Monthly Trend
- Significant increase expected from May 2024 to July 2024
- Peak around July 2024
- Stable fluctuations after the peak

## Forecasting and Predictive Analysis

### LSTM Model Performance
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 68.98
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 8.31

The LSTM model outperformed SARIMAX, showing higher accuracy and reliability in predicting call volumes.

## Recommendations

1. **Resource Allocation**
   - Allocate more resources during peak times (July and Mondays)
   - Schedule training or maintenance during off-peak times (Saturdays and low-volume months)
   - Use forecasts for future resource planning

2. **Call Volume Reduction Strategies**
   - Identify and address common issues
   - Enhance customer education through FAQs and tutorials
   - Implement service improvements based on common complaints
